This repo contains the source code used to train the models featured in my masters thesis,
which can be found in the docs directory: [Forecasting Returns for High Frequency Cryptocurrency Websocket Data
](./docs/writeup/main.pdf).

### Abstract
In this paper we explore various machine learning models for predicting high frequency re-
turns for four of the most popular cryptocurrency perpetual futures trading pairs, BTCUSDT,
ETHUSDT, MATICUSDT and SOLUSDT. Specifically we train and evaluate models for classify-
ing the direction of the smoothed mid-price change for high frequency prediction horizons. We
introduce a novel data set, constructed from a live WebSocket stream from Binance, the worlds
largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange. We explore how different data representations af-
fect model performance and how performance varies for different trading pairs and prediction
horizons. We use a mixture of traditional machine learning and deep learning models and show
that simple and explainable traditional models can rival the performance of far larger and more
complex state of the art deep learning models.
